* Serokell beamer theme
This is a beamer theme that tries to conform to Serokell brand identity guide.

It is based on [[https://github.com/junwei-wang/beamerthemeNord][beamer theme Nord]], but changed quite heavily.

To use it in your presentation, add

#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\usetheme{Serokell}
#+END_SRC

to your beamer presentation, or

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
theme: Serokell
#+END_SRC

to metadata or your pandoc presentation. Build with

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
TEXINPUTS=.:/path/to/beamer-theme-serokell/: <...>
#+END_SRC

Mind the =:= at the end of =TEXINPUTS=, otherwise default search path won't be included!
